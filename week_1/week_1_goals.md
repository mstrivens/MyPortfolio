## Goals

**Strive for perfect code quality**

• Read up more on what it means to have good  quality code
• Ensure refactoring code to make it more intuitive and descriptive √
• Ensure following DRY

**Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods**

• Read up again on TDD
• Ensure awareness and following test-driven development techniques
• Ensure writing to simplest test code and then solving that with the
  simplest program solution
• Evidence: Boris Bikes √

**Pair using driver-navigator style**

• Read up again on best practice for drive-navigator √
• Follow this to help myself and partner as much as possible √
• Get feedback and review after pairing session √
• Evidence: Pair program weekly challenge √

**Develop an effective debugging process**

• Start to develop a hard-written effective debugging process
• Should contain a step-by-step approach
• Should be able to explain the process and why
• Read further on this
• Evidence: do 2 debugging challenges √

**Describe some basic principles like encapsulation, SRP**

• Read practical on encapsulation √
• Understand what it is and how is applies √
• Test this knowledge with a practical challenges √
• Test understanding by being able write a simple blog description √
• Do 2 exercises using encapsulation or SRP √
• Stretch goal: Finish exercise 4 on secret diary

**Read up further on self-led learning and goal-setting**

• Including SMART, pomodoro technique √
• Finish setting goals for week and set up todo tasks on trello √
• Plan out daily learning tasks √

**Evidence**

### Daily Goals

**Tuesday 2nd March**

GOAL: Understand encapsulation and how it applies √
PLAN: Work through encapsulation practical and wikipedia page √
EVIDENCE: Complete 2 simple challenges, write brief description in own words √

**Wednesday 3rd March**

GOAL: Follow an effective debugging process √
PLAN: Attend debugging workshop and read further materials √
EVIDENCE: Be able to rubber duck it and test with 2 simple debugging challenges.√
Stretch goal: Finish Secret diary challenge

Learns: Followed an effective debugging system and completed 1 challenge out of 2.
Made further progress on Secret Diary Challenge
Made good progress on pair-programming. Learnt about raise_error testing, as well as, attr_reader.

Need further knowledge on attr_reader and instance variables. √
To-Do: Git update - Week goals repo, course skills repo and boris_bikes repo √
Complete: Secret Diary Challenge & Second debugging challenge.
Post blog post

**Thursday 4th March**

GOAL: Further Understanding of TDD √
PLAN; Attend workshop, take notes, read resources and complete practical √
EVIDENCE: Complete workshop exercises, rubber duck it
Stretch Goal: Read up further on instance variables √
Complete debugging fizzbuzz skills workshop √ + debug and complete secret diary practical(look at attr_accessor in conjunction with) + complete TDD practical

Reflection: Understood principles of TDD further. Specifically the route to follow in writing a feature test, failing it and then running a unit test which fails. Then writing the code until it passes. The feature code must be based on the user stories.
Also learned about attributes. The attribute reader is important because it allows an instance variable created by a class to be read by that class. also better understood using fail errors.

**Friday 5th March**

GOAL: TDD workshop. Look through mocking
Discuss attr_reader to assess understanding.
PLAN: TDD workshop + TDD practicals √
Discuss attr_reader with peer group to assess understanding √
EVIDENCE: Can explain attr_reader. Can finish TDD practical  √

Learns: Really good day. Worked hard and made a lot of progress.

In the morning - completed dice_game challenge. Biggest learns were testing for randomness.
Testing arguments to equal the input
Testing arrays to contain something whilst controlling what is passed in
Good to remember for testing that  if you can control what is passed in you can test the behaviour rather than the state.

PM - went through setting an array as an initial attribute on a class instance
Setting default values and constants
Using tests to show when method names need to be changed
Using attr_accessor to set status attibute which can be set or changed when bike.status used
USE CURLY BRACES ON ERROR TESTS AND ONE LINE SYNTAX

Week learning - don't need to go through all resources so don't stress. Take time to reflect.
